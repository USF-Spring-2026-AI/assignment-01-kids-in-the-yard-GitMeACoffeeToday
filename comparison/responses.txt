● Which tool(s) did you use?
    - ChatGPT (unpaid vers.)

● If you used an LLM, what was your prompt to the LLM?
    - see prompt.txt (its really long)

● What differences are there between your implementation and the LLM?
    - LLM has created many more files and spread out implementation across them, some minor style changes.
    - Did not implement an interactive interface with the user despite being asked to in the prompt.

● What changes would you make to your implementation in general based on suggestions from the
LLM?
    - Nothing. The LLM didn't make use of the pandas package, which would have simplified the amount of code and files necessary
    to acomplish what it was instructed to. There are some minor style-related things that I would probably use going forward, but
    functionality-wise, not much. Additionally, unless you're using the paid version of GPT, you can only upload 3 files daily.
    When it comes to the .csv files, I found it rather important to look over their contents first to understand the data before
    attempting to implement this assignment. The fact that GPT has a context limit for big prompts can be is problematic.
        - Uploading files for the LLM to understand is one thing, limiting that functionality to paid is another. Are people going to
        pay to program? What if the internet goes down and you can't just shove six or more .csv files into the LLM and expect it to
        produce magically working code? (it took a few iterations to fix some initial bugs, but god forbid if I tried to make it produce
        exactly what the assignment wanted).
            - God forbid if there were more than 6 .csv files, each with their own nuances in data organization (tirade over).

● What changes would you refuse to make?
    - Not using pandas when pandas would simplify the amount of code needed to get the implementation working.
    - Implementing this entirely through an LLM. I found it a soulless and mind numbingly boring effort, as well as a
    somewhat frustrating venture to get this cl*nker to understand the contents of the .csv files, as well as the assignment.
