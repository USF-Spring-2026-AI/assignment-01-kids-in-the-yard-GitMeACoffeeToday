● Which tool(s) did you use?
    - ChatGPT (unpaid vers.)

● If you used an LLM, what was your prompt to the LLM?
    - see prompt.txt (its really long)

● What differences are there between your implementation and the LLM?
    - LLM has created many more files and spread out implementation across them, some minor style changes.
    - Did not implement an interactive interface with the user despite being asked to in the prompt.

● What changes would you make to your implementation in general based on suggestions from the
LLM?
    - Nothing. The LLM didn't make use of the pandas package, which would have simplified the process of reading the processing data from the .csv files.
    There are some minor style-related things that I would probably use going forward, but functionality-wise, not much.

● What changes would you refuse to make?
    - Not using pandas when pandas would simplify the amount of code needed to get the implementation working.
