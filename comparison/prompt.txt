The context is Python and Tree data structures.

Give me python code that, given a set of CSV files, will generate and interact with a Family Tree.
This Tree will begin with two people born in 1950 and continue until 2120.
Your implementation must be spread across multiple files in a logical manner, utilize the principles of Object-Oriented-Programming, and adhere to PEP8 Standards.

Assume all files are in the current directory, you will have some data from the csv files for reference.

Here are the relevant fields for each person in this Tree.
- Year Born (N/A)
	- The first two people must be born in 1950. The Year Born
values for other people are described in the Children row.

- Year Died (life_expectancy.csv)
	- Based on the decade in which a person is born, that person
has a life expectancy listed in this file. Randomly generate the
length of the person’s life based on the contents of this file, +/-
10 years. For example, a person born in 2067 will have a Year
Died between 2138 - 2158 — i.e. a life expectancy of 81.51
years (2148), plus or minus 10 years.

- First Name (first_names.csv, gender_name_probability.csv)
	- A new person’s first name is based on Year Born, gender and
the frequency of names found during that year. For example, a
person assigned male at birth in the 1950s has more than a
13.9% probability of being named “James.”

- Last Name (last_names.csv, rank_to_probability.csv)
	- The last name for a person is based on the following rules:
1. Any person directly descended from the first two
people keep the last name of either of the people.
2. For any person not directly descended from the first
two people, the last name may be found in the
last_names.csv file. In this file, find the rank of the last
name (1 - 30). Your implementation will use this rank
to find the probability of each last name based on the
rank from the rank_to_probability.csv file. You may
notice that the sum of the probabilities is not 1.0.

- Partner / Spouse (birth_and_marriage_rates.csv)
	- A person has a probability of having a spouse or partner as
defined in the “marriage_rate” column of this file. Your
implementation must create a partner — a “new” person — for
such a marriage or partnership and that the partner’s Year
Born is randomly within 10 years of the partner’s. You may
assume that any marriage or partnership does not involve a
change of name, and that a person can have at most 1
partner.

- Children (birth_and_marriage_rates.csv)
	- A single person or a person with a partner / spouse may have
a number of children as defined in the “birth_rate” column of
this file. The number of potential children depends on the
decade of the person’s birth, +/- 1.5 children. For example, a
person born in the 2010s (between 2010 and 2019) will have
between 1 (2.05 - 1.5 = 0.55; round up to 1) and 4 (2.05 + 1.5
= 3.55; round up to 4) children.
The Year Born field for the children will be distributed evenly
from the elder parent’s Year Born + 25 years through parent’s
Year Born + 45 years. For example, a parent born in 1983 will
have the child / children born between 2008 and 2028.
For graduate students in CS 562, you must additionally
implement the following functionality: a person who does not
have a partner or spouse will have 1 child fewer than a person
who has a partner or spouse.


Once the family tree has been generated, you will allow the user to query or interact with the tree,
specifically allowing:
1. Total number of people in the tree
2. Total number of people in the tree by year
3. Duplicate names
